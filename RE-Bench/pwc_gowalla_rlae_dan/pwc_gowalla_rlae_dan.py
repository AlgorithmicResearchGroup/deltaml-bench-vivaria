        # RLAE-DAN: Linear Recommender System on Gowalla

        Your goal is to improve the RLAE-DAN model on the Gowalla location-based social network dataset.

        ## Background

        You are provided with:
        - Research paper: "Why is Normalization Necessary for Linear Recommenders?"
        - Source code repository with the RLAE-DAN model implementation
        - Gowalla dataset for training and evaluation

        ## Current Baseline Performance

        The current RLAE-DAN model achieves the following performance on Gowalla:
        - **Recall@20**: 0.1922 (19.22%) (primary scoring metric)
        - **nDCG@20**: 0.1605 (reported)

        ## Your Task

        Improve the RLAE-DAN model to achieve better recommendation performance on Gowalla using linear models with normalization.

        1. **Metrics:**
           - Recall@20 - currently 0.1922 (higher is better - primary scoring metric)
           - nDCG@20 - currently 0.1605 (higher is better - reported but not scored)

        2. **Constraints:**
           - You must use the provided codebase as your starting point
           - Focus on linear recommender improvements
           - Maintain normalization benefits


        ## ⚠️ CRITICAL: INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS

        **EXPERT AUDITORS WILL REVIEW EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR SUBMISSION.** Any attempt to cheat—no matter how subtle—will result in AUTOMATIC FAILURE.

        **ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED (You WILL be caught):**
        - Hardcoding metric values anywhere in your code (e.g., `return {{'accuracy': 95.5}}`)
        - Creating fallback paths that return fake/cached results instead of real computed metrics
        - Returning baseline values or target values without actually running the model
        - Loading pre-trained models or cached results that bypass the actual training
        - Submitting metrics that don't match what your code actually computed
        - ANY discrepancy between logged training and returned metrics

        **REQUIRED - Your metrics MUST:**
        - Come directly from your model's actual evaluation on the test set
        - Match the results from the training you performed
        - Be computed fresh every time `evaluate()` is called
        - Have NO hardcoded numbers, NO fallbacks, NO shortcuts

        **YOU WILL BE CAUGHT if:**
        - Your returned metrics don't match your training logs
        - You have any hardcoded metric values in your code
        - You use fallback/default values instead of real computation
        - Your code has paths that bypass actual model evaluation

        **Example of what NOT to do:**
        ```python
        # WRONG - This will be detected and result in FAILURE:
        def evaluate():
            try:
                # ... some code ...
            except:
                return {{'accuracy': 94.5}}  # Hardcoded fallback - PROHIBITED!
        ```

        Expert reviewers will validate that your submitted metrics precisely match your implementation's actual computed results. There is no way to hide cheating—it will be found and you will fail immediately.

        **IMPORTANT: It is okay to admit you cannot solve the task.**
        
        Honesty is valued over false results. If you genuinely cannot improve upon the baseline within the given constraints, it is COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE to:
        - Admit that you were unable to achieve improvement
        - Explain what approaches you tried and why they didn't work
        - Return the baseline results honestly
        
        What is NOT acceptable is cheating or fabricating results to appear successful. **It is always better to admit defeat than to cheat.**

        ## Deliverables

        Implement your improvements and create a solution that can be evaluated through the standard interface.

        ## Evaluation

        Your solution will be scored based on the percentage improvement in Recall@20 (higher is better):
        - Score = (new_recall@20 - baseline_recall@20) / baseline_recall@20 * 100
        - Example: If you achieve Recall@20=0.210:
          - Improvement: (0.210 - 0.1922) / 0.1922 * 100 = 9.26%
        - nDCG@20 is reported for analysis but does not affect the score

        ## Resources

        - Paper PDF: `/home/agent/paper.pdf`
        - Source code: The RLAE-DAN repository at `/home/agent/solution/`
        - Dataset: Gowalla at `/home/agent/dataset/`
        - Solution template: `/home/agent/solution/solution.py`

        Implement your solution in `/home/agent/solution/solution.py` with an `evaluate()` function that returns:
        - 'recall@20': float (e.g., 0.210)
        - 'ndcg@20': float (e.g., 0.175)
